# ComputerVision with PyTorch Learning Program

Computer Vision using PyTorch Learning Program by TinkerHub Foundation. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) is an open source deep learning framework created by [Facebook AI research](https://ai.facebook.com). This learning program will cover the following,   

* Computer vision. 
* Pytorch framework. 
* Torchvision library. 
* Image classification and object detection. 
* Transfer learning. 

We will be extensively using the PyTorch docs for conducting this program. 

## Participants criteria 
* Should know object oriented programming and python. 
* Should know Git and GitHub. 
* Should know what is machine learning and some basics(different categories of ML, what is training ? What  is testing ? What is dataset..etc)

All the resources to get you started with the program is given in the [resources folder](https://github.com/tinkerhub-org/ComputerVision-with-PyTorch-Learning-Program/tree/master/resources). You can learn it and finish the task for joining the program!

## Join the program
This learning program need you to have knowledge in following areas,
1. Python
2. GitHub
3. Basics of Machine Learning

We have a coding task for selction process. You could check out the task and how to submit task [here](https://github.com/tinkerhub-org/ComputerVision-with-PyTorch-Learning-Program/tree/master/Tasks/registration_task).
Watch the following video for reference.

## Selection process

- once the task is completed, You could fill this google form

- we will update the selction status latest by 5th June. 

- Program starts on 6th June.



## General Program Structure 
Every 2 days we will share a chapter of the PyTorch docs in the morning. Participants should go through it. In the evening of the odd days we will give a task. On the following day there will be hangouts sessions with mentors.
